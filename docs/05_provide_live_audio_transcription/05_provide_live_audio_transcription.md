# Exercise 05 - Provide live audio transcription to the Azure OpenAI service

## Lab Scenario

You have already assisted Contoso Suites with one scenario: incorporating chat with their existing data and API infrastructure. You have also shown them some of the capability available in the Azure AI Services Speech service. They would now like to harness this power in their call center, providing customer service agents with additional context-relevant information.

In this exercise, you will expand on the audio transcription work you did in Exercise 04 and will focus on live audio transcription and context extraction. You will also include capabilities to transcribe pre-recorded customer service calls and offline support requests.

## Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

* Incorporate audio file upload and audio transcription into a Streamlit app
* Incorporate live microphone transcription of a full audio stream into a Streamlit app
* Check whether a call meets compliance requirements

## Lab Duration

* **Estimated Time:** 90 minutes
