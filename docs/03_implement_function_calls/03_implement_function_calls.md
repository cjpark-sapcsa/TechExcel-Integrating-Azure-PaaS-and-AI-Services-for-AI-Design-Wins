# Exercise 03 - Implement function calling to integrate with external APIs

## Lab Scenario

Bringing our own data is one great way to enhance GPT models in Azure OpenAI, allowing them to answer questions specific to our circumstances. Another way to customize responses and enhance system capabilities involves function calling, a native way for GPT models to formulate API calls and structure data outputs based on the functions we specify. In this exercise, you will create a function to supplement chat conversations with customer data.

## Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

* Implement a customer account information lookup API endpoint against Cosmos DB using C#
* Create a function in Python to perform customer account lookup as part of a broader conversation
* Incorporate function calling into the existing chat completions solution

## Lab Duration

* **Estimated Time:** 60 minutes
