# Task 02 - Query data from Azure AI Search (20 minutes)

## Introduction

The ChatGPT series of models available in Azure OpenAI has been trained on a wide variety of datasets online, but these datasets tend to be publicly available. For private and proprietary datasets, we will need a different approach than to expect ChatGPT has the available information. In this second task of the exercise, we will push data into an Azure storage account and convert it into an Azure AI Search index.

## Description

In this task, you will load data that Contoso Suites staff has provided to you into Azure Blob Storage. This data contains a summary, in JSON format, of several of their resort properties and hotels located on the resorts. This is an example of the type of data the company would like to use to enhance chat results, so they would like you to incorporate this data into the Azure OpenAI proof of concept. You may find these files in [the src/data folder](https://github.com/microsoft/TechExcel-Integrating-Azure-PaaS-and-AI-Services-for-AI-Design-Wins/tree/main/src/data) for the repository.

The key tasks are as follows:

1. Import the data from **Resorts.txt** into a container named `contoso-suites`.
2. Import the data from **Hotels.txt** into a container named `contoso-suites`.
3. Import the data from **FAQ.txt** into a container named `contoso-suites`.
4. Create a `contoso-suites-faq` index in Azure AI Search, built on the three files in the `contoso-suites` container in your storage account. You should embed with `text-embedding-002-ada` and support Hybrid (Vector + Keyword) search. The Contoso Suites team would like a script that performs this action rather than operating through a UI, as they plan to do this on a regular basis.
5. Update the front-end code in `src/ContosoSuitesDashboard/` to enable chat operations against the FAQ index.
   1. Create a file called `secrets.toml` in `src/ContosoSuitesDashboard/.streamlit/`. Pattern it after `secrets.template.toml` but include your Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Search details.
   2. The Contoso Suites team has followed instructions online on how to interact with an Azure OpenAI model deployment. They would like you to extend the code in `src/ContosoSuitesDashboard/pages/1_Chat_with_Data.py` to ensure any queries make use of the Azure AI Search index you have created rather than relying on the inbuilt knowledge of the default GPT-4 model.
   3. You can test your work by running the following queries. The first two queries should respond with relevant information. The final two queries should not give you a valid response because they ask for information outside the scope of our data.
      1. Which hotels on the island of Curacao have EV stations?
      2. Do I need to pay extra money to use an EV station when I am a guest of the hotel?
      3. How tall is the highest mountain peak in the Alps?
      4. What is the current political situation in Thailand?

## Success Criteria

- You have created an Azure Blob Storage container and uploaded the Resorts and Hotels data files.
- You are able to view the files in Azure Blob Storage.
- You have executed code to generate a new Azure AI Search index.
- Your front-end application can handle chat against the `contoso-suites-faq` index.

## Solution

<details markdown="block">
<summary>Expand this section to view the solution for importing data into storage accounts.</summary>

- Make sure you use the storage account you created in exercise 1, as the storage account must be in the same region as Azure AI Search.
- Navigate to the storage account in [the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
- Select the **Containers** option from the **Data storage** menu.
- Create a new container using the **+ Container** option. Name the container `contoso-suites`.
- Inside the "contoso-suites" container, select the **Upload** option and choose each text file.
- The files do not need to be in separate folders in the blob storage container.

TODO!

- Open up a terminal and ensure that you are currently logged in using `az login`.
- Ensure that you can find your Azure AI Search service using the command `az search service list --resource-group {YOUR RESOURCE GROUP NAME}`. You should see one result.

(error hint: if you receive a message about data source connection failing, make sure your search service system identity has Storage Blob Data Reader permissions on the storage account)
(Create via UI instead? Not sure what to do for programmatic access! << Could ask Daniel or Chris T. >>)

- Create a file called `secrets.toml` in `src/ContosoSuitesDashboard/.streamlit/`. Copy the contents of `secrets.template.toml` as a starting point. Then, fill in the details from your Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Search services.
  - In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), find the resource group you created.
  - Navigate to the Azure OpenAI service in your resource group.
  - In the **Resource Management** menu, select the **Keys and Endpoint** entry. Copy the value of **KEY 1** and save it as `key` in the `[aoai]` section of your secrets file. Copy the value of **Endpoint** and save it as `endpoint`.
  - Return to the resource group and then select your Azure AI Search service.
  - Copy the value of **Url** from the **Essentials** panel and save it as `endpoint` in the `[search]` section of your secrets file.

    ![Select the Azure AI Search service URL and save it to the Secrets file.](../../media/Solution/0102_SearchEndpoint.png)

  - In the **Settings** menu, select the **Keys** entry. Copy the value of **Primary admin key** and save it as `key` in the `[search]` section of your secrets file.
  - Return to the resource group and then select your Azure AI Search service.
  - Copy the value of **Url** from the **Essentials** panel and save it as `endpoint` in the `[search]` section of your secrets file.
  - Return to the resource group and select your Azure AI Services Speech service.
  - In the **Resource Management** menu, select the **Keys and Endpoint** entry. Copy the value of **KEY 1** and save it as `key` in the `[speech]` section of your secrets file. Copy the value of **Location/Region** and save it as `region`.
- Open the file `src/ContosoSuitesDashboard/pages/1_Chat_with_Data.py`. The code will run as-is, but will not have knowledge of your search index. To support chat with data, make the following changes to the Python script.
  - Change the `handle_chat_prompt()` function to accept the following signature:

    ```python
    def handle_chat_prompt(prompt, aoai_deployment_name, aoai_endpoint, aoai_key, search_endpoint, search_key, search_index_name):
    ```

  - Add the search secrets to the `main()` function, below the Azure OpenAI secrets and above the for loop to display message history.

    ```python
    search_endpoint = st.secrets["search"]["endpoint"]
    search_key = st.secrets["search"]["key"]
    search_index_name = st.secrets["search"]["index_name"]
    ```

  - Change the call to `handle_chat_prompt()` in the `main()` function to include the new search parameters.

    ```python
    handle_chat_prompt(prompt, aoai_deployment_name, aoai_endpoint, aoai_key, search_endpoint, search_key, search_index_name)
    ```

  - Change the `create_chat_completion()` function to accept the following signature:

    ```python
    def create_chat_completion(aoai_deployment_name, messages, aoai_endpoint, aoai_key, search_endpoint, search_key, search_index_name):
    ```

  - Replace the `return` statement's chat completion request with one that includes an Azure AI Search data source.

    ```python
    return client.chat.completions.create(
        model=aoai_deployment_name,
        messages=[
            {"role": m["role"], "content": m["content"]}
            for m in messages
        ],
        stream=True,
        extra_body={
            "data_sources": [
                {
                    "type": "azure_search",
                    "parameters": {
                        "endpoint": search_endpoint,
                        "index_name": search_index_name,
                        "authentication": {
                            "type": "api_key",
                            "key": search_key
                        }
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    )
    ```

  - Inside the `handle_chat_prompt()` function, replace the `for` loop with the following code:

    ```python
    for response in create_chat_completion(aoai_deployment_name, st.session_state.messages, aoai_endpoint, aoai_key, search_endpoint, search_key, search_index_name):
    ```

- In order to test your code, navigate to the `src/ContosoSuitesDashboard/` folder in your terminal. Then, run the following command to begin the Streamlit dashboard.

    ```python
    python -m streamlit run Index.py
    ```
