# Exercise 04 - Implement audio transcription using Azure AI Services Speech service

## Lab Scenario

So far, we have looked at two common scenarios for extending the capabilities of OpenAI chat services: bringing your own data and function completion. There are other ways to bring OpenAI intelligence to customer support agents, and the second half of this training will cover a big quality of life improvements for customer support agents: audio transcription and intelligent operations based on audio recordings.

In this exercise, you will incorporate speech to text capabilities into the existing Streamlit dashboard, allowing users to speak their requests to the chat service you have created.

## Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

* Create an Azure AI Services Speech service and test it using the OpenAI Studio Chat playground
* Incorporate speech to text into the existing chat completions solution

## Lab Duration

* **Estimated Time:** 60 minutes
