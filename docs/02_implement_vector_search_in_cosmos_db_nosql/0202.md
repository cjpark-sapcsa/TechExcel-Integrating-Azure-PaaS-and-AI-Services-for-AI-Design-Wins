# Task 02 - Create and store vector embeddings (30 minutes)

## Introduction

Vectors, also known as embeddings or vector embeddings, are mathematical representations of data in a high-dimensional space. In this space, each dimension corresponds to a feature of the data, and tens of thousands of dimensions might be used to represent sophisticated data. A vector's position in this space represents its characteristics. Words, phrases, or entire documents, and images, audio, and other types of data can all be vectorized. An embedding is a special format of data representation that can be easily utilized by machine learning models and algorithms. The embedding is an information dense representation of the semantic meaning of a piece of text. Each embedding is a vector of floating point numbers, such that the distance between two embeddings in the vector space is correlated with semantic similarity between two inputs in the original format. Azure OpenAI provides several models for creating vector embeddings, and for this exercise, you will use the `text-embedding-ada-002` model.

To store the generated embeddings, you will use a vector database. Vector datasbases are designed to store and manage vector embeddings. The vector database you will use is Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL. It allows you to store vectors alongside traditional schema-free data within your documents, streamlining data management and significantly enhancing the efficiency of vector operations. Keeping all relevant data in a single logical unit simplifies your data architecture, making it easy to understand and manage.

## Description

Create and store vectors embeddings (30 min)

   1. Update Azure function with appropriate connection string details.
   2. Run function locally, set a break point, and add a new maintenance task via the Cosmos DB Data Explorer to see how it works.
   3. Review updated record in Cosmos DB to via generated vectors.
   4. Deploy the function to Azure
      1. Configure app settings (connection string)
   5. Populate the `MaintenanceRequests` container with data from the `PropertyMaintenance.json` file in the [/src/data folder](https://github.com/microsoft/TechExcel-Integrating-Azure-PaaS-and-AI-Services-for-AI-Design-Wins/tree/main/src/data) of the repository.
   6. Review data in data explorer to confirm the function is processing newly added data.

In the prior task, you configured Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL as an integrated vector database. In this task, you will use an Azure Function and the Azure Cosmos DB change feed to generate vector embeddings for property maintenance tasks and save those into the `MaintenaceTasks` container in Cosmos DB.

You will conclude by uploading data supplied by the Contoso Suites staff into the containers you created in Cosmos DB. These JSON data files contain user reviews and maintenance tasks for several hotels on their resorts. They offer an example of the types of data the company believes can benefit from the similarity search capabilities provided by Vector Search in Cosmos DB, so they would like you to incorporate this data into the proof of concept.

The key tasks are as follows:

1. Build an Azure Function with an Azure Cosmos DB change feed trigger to vectorize documents added to the `MaintenanceRequests` container.
2. Test the function by running it locally:
   1. You will need to create a `local.settings.json` file containing the required settings:
      - `CosmosDBConnectionString`
      - `AzureOpenAIEndpoint`
      - `AzureOpenAIKey`
      - `DeploymentName`: This must be the deployment name of the `text-embedding-ada-002` model in your Azure OpenAI instance.
   2. Insert the following record into the `MaintenanceRequests` container and observe the results of the function execution.

        ```json
        {
          "hotel_id": 1, 
          "hotel": "Oceanview Inn",
          "source": "customer",
          "date": "2024-08-10",
          "details": "The air conditioning (A/C) unit in room 105 is malfunctioning and making a loud noise. Customer will be out of the room between noon and 2 PM. This needs immediate maintenance attention.",
          "room_number": 227
        }
        ```

3. Examine the function input via breakpoints added before running.
4. Examine the data in Cosmos DB and look at the vector embeddings inserted into the document.
5. Deploy the function to Azure.
6. Navigate to the live screen and watch the logs.
7. Upload the `PropertyMaintenance.json` file to insert bulk data into the `MaintenanceRequests` container.
8. Observe the files being processed.
9.  Execute a `VectorDistance()` query via Data Explorer.
   1.  Create new query.
   2.  Add query below...
   3.  Observe results and `SimilarityScore` values.


3. Vectorize data using a `text-embedding-ada-002` deployment in Azure OpenAI.
4. Write the generated vectors into the `vector-embeddings` fields in the MaintenanceRequests` container.


2. Following is a sample customer request that a Contoso Suites customer service agent has received in the past. "I am looking for a sunny beachside resort on an island. There need to be diving opportunities nearby and I'd prefer it not to be too crowded an area. Which resorts would you recommend?" Enter this request into the chat session and note the response.

    {: .note }
    > You may receive a message that your chat service is not able to complete the request based on its available information. If you do, please try rephrasing this as two separate requests. The first is, "Which resorts are on islands?" The second is, "Of those resorts, which have good diving opportunities?"

3. Following is a sample customer request that a Contoso Suites customer service agent has received in the past. "Our family is celebrating my mother's 90th birthday and we want to have that celebration in Aruba. Do you have a hotel that can accommodate 19 room rentals? And are there any reception rooms at that hotel?" Enter this request into the chat session and note the response.

## Success Criteria

- You have created vectorized indexes in Azure AI Search for resorts and hotels.
- You have demonstrated how to use the Chat playground to allow ChatGPT to interact with custom data.
