# Exercise 02 - Implement contextual grounding using vector search in Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL

## Lab Scenario

Vector search provides a powerful technique for efficiently finding information within blocks of text. Using Azure Cosmos DB, vector embeddings generated using Azure OpenAI can be stored alongside data. In this exercise, you will add vector search capabilities to Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL and integrate search functionality into the Consoso Suites Customer Information System (CIS) and Bookings applications.

## Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

- Enable the Vector Search feature in Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL
- Define container vector policies
- Specify vector indexing policies
- Generate vector embeddings using Azure OpenAI and store them into Cosmos DB
- Peform similarity searches using the `VectorDistance()` function in Cosmos DB

## Lab Duration

- **Estimated Time:** 60 minutes
